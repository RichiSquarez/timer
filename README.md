<h1>One of my first projects - Timer :)</h1>
<p>It was made on OOP base. So you can make as many timers as you want</p>
<div>
    ##Example of usage
    <div style="width:fit-content"><p style="color:orange; background-color: black; display: inline">```const timer1 = new Timer(5, "game");```</p> - First argument is the duration of timer, second argument is unique name of the timer || It's very important to give unique name to prevent errors </div>
