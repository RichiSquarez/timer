<h1>One of my first projects - Timer :)</h1>
<p>It was made on OOP base. So you can make as many timers as you want</p>
<div>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 100px">Example of usage</h2>
    <div style="width:fit-content"><p style="color:orange; background-color: black; display: inline">const timer1 = new Timer(5, "game");</p> - First argument is the duration of time, second argument is unique name of the time || It's very important to give unique name to prevent errors </div>
